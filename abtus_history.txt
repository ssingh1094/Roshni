HISTORY:
	ROSHNI was founded in 1998 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh with the objective of providing direct services for persons with neurological and other impairments, raise awareness about disability, build capacities to increase the numbers and strengthen the knowledge and skills of the lay and the professional, family and community, to enable the inclusion of persons with disability into the community.
	
	    ROSHNI is a project of the Ramakrishna Ashrama Gwalior, based in northern Madhya Pradesh. Since its inception, ROSHNI has made every effort to reach out to the local community and the surrounding districts at every possible level and has been providing a wide range of services for all age groups.
			    ROSHNI had a Pilot Project in the Neo natal ICU at a private Hospital from December 2004-2007, but despite these efforts, some children reach ROSHNI at a later age and miss the formative years.
					The Swami Vivekananda Autism ComDEALL Early Intervention Unit for Children with Autism Spectrum and Communication Disorders (Age 2-6 years), was started in 2012, with the aim of preparing the young children for mainstream Schools. There are currently 12 children in the Unit. A Total of 25 children have been registered, since the ComDEALL Unit commenced. In the above unit we start intensive therapeutic and educational services, at an early age, to enable them to gain education in mainstream schools. The ROSHNI Parents’ Support  Group, meets every month and Parents  and Community workers are trained, to empower them to take care of their children’s special needs. 
						ROSHNI has played a pioneering and path-breaking role in securing the rights of people with autism and demystifying the condition through ceaseless advocacy and various awareness drives. The focus has been to move away from seeing ‘disability’ as one homogeneous entity, to the understanding that the needs of individuals with autism are unique, and hence policies and services must be geared to cater to these specific needs.
							In a largely voiceless sector, wherein the condition itself precludes the existence of a large number of self-advocates, ROSHNI has been the voice of those with autism. We continue to lobby to secure the rights of the autism community, in any situation where persons with autism may be differentiated against purely because of their autism. Whether it is a child with autism being denied the right to board an aircraft or being asked to leave a mainstream school, ROSHNI has brought parents, media and the general population together against such discrimination.
